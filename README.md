# student_management

#Technologies used

-   Node .js
-   Express .js
-   Mongoose / MongoDB
-   JWT (Jason Web Tokens) for authentication
-   EJS ( A templating language)

## It is a fully fledged backend system to authenticate users (students, instructors and admin users), group studnets, show students' progress
 _Use of Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)._

Remember that a student is only enrolled by the admins of the hub
it also shows the classes that one is enrolled in

# Use of EJS template

Note that for visualization, we have used ejs which is a templating engine so that one can interact with the system

## Note that this project is majorly a backend and one exciting thing is the structure used.; Very Demure!
