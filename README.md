# student_management

#Technologies used

-   Node .js
-   Express .js
-   Mongoose / MongoDb
-   JWT (Jason Web Tokens) for authentication

## It is a fully fledgd backend syste from signing in and signing up for both students and instrictors.

Remember that a student is only enrolled by the admins of the hub
it also shows the classes that one is enrolled in

# Use of ejs template

Note that for visualization, we have used ejs which is a templating engine so as one is able to interact with the system

## Note that this project is majorly a backend and one exciting thing is the structure used.; Very Demure!
